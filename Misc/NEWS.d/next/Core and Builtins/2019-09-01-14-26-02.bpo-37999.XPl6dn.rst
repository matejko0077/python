Builtin and extension functions that take integer arguments no longer accept
:class:`~decimal.Decimal`\ s, :class:`~fractions.Fraction`\ s and other
objects that can be converted to integers only with a loss (e.g. that have
the :meth:`~object.__int__` method but do not have the
:meth:`~object.__index__` method).
