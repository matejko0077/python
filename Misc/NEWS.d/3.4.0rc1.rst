io.TextIOWrapper (and hence the open() builtin) now uses the internal codec
marking system added for issue #19619 to throw LookupError for known non-

For at least Python 3.4, the statistics module will require that all inputs
for a single operation be of a single consistent type, or else a mixed of

common type.

poll and epoll now round the timeout away from zero, instead of rounding
towards zero, in select and selectors modules: select.epoll.poll(),
selectors.PollSelector.poll() and selectors.EpollSelector.poll(). For
example, a timeout of one microsecond (1e-6) is now rounded to one
millisecondi (1e-3), instead of being rounded to zero.  However, the
granularity property and asyncio's resolution feature were removed again.

Argument Clinic's signature format has been revised again. The new syntax is
